SOME LATEX NOTES - From the Derek Banas' Tutorial
Latex is a typesetting system which is the standard for publication of scientific documents. You can make documents with this bunch of commands, even E-Books & more.

To start the creation of a document:
\documentclass[a4paper, 12pt]{book}
- Commands start with a name [optional arguments] {required arguments}
	o Optional args could be the size of the paper & the size of the font.
		+ These are some options:
			• twocolumn: 2 column pages.
			• titlepage: \maketitle generates a title page.
			• legno: puts equation numbers on the left side.
			• flegn: left align equations versus center.
			• twoside: print on both sides of paper.
			• openright: if twoside is used chapters begin on right hand page.
			• landscape: if listed it displays in landscape.
		+ These are options for paper sizes:
			• letterpaper (11 x 8.5 in), a4paper (29.7 x 21 cm), legalpaper (14 x 8.5 in), a5paper (21 x 14.8cm), executivepaper (10.5 x 7.25 in), and b5paper (25 x 17.6cm).
	o Required args allows you to choose the type of layout for your doc.
		+ These are some options:
			• article: for articles in scientific journals, presentations, short reports, program documentation, invitations, …
			• proc: a class for proceedings based on the articles class.
			• minimal: is as small as it can get. It only sets a page size and a base font. It is mainly used for debugging purposes.
			• report: for longer reports containing several chapters, small books, thesis, …
			• book: for real books.
			• slides: for slides. The class uses big sans serif letters.
			• memoir: for changing sensibly the output of the document. It is based on the book class, but you can create any kind of document with it.
			• letter: for writing letters.
			• beamer: for writing presentations

To define fonts across the entire document:
\renewcommand{familydefault}{\sfdefault}
Packages allow you to import functionalities for the document creation. One common package that you’d like to import is the Babel package, which allows you to define how you want 
hyphenation to be handled based off your chosen language.

To import babel package:
\usepackage[english]{babel}

To import filler text:
\usepackage{blindtext}
ONCE you’re done setting up the creation of your document and importing all the necessary packages that is where your preamble is going to end, and you can start your document --->
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To define your document:

\begin{document}				% command to begin the document
\title{\Large{\textbf{LaTeX Tutorial}}}		% define title with large font, in bold, & its name
\author{By Souheil Al-awar}			% define name of the author
\date{January 20, 2019}				% define date

\maketitle					% command to create the entire title page

\blindtext[5]					% it prints out pointless (5 is the amount for 1 pg)

\end{document}					% command to end the document

% Above is the example of a document with a title page & an extra page with pointless data.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

These are some more common packages you might have to use in your document:
\usepackage{microtype}			% improve justification across the entire document
\usepackage{graphicx}			% to be able to include pictures of any type
\usepackage{wrapfig}			% to wrap text around our pictures
\usepackage{enumitem}			% makes lists look nicer
\usepackage{fancyhdr}			% fancy headers
\usepackage{amsmath}			% to use math formulas
\usepackage{index}			% use automatically generated indexes

More commands:
\\ : Generates a new line.
\section{sectionName} : Generates a new enumerated section.
	- Whenever you want to start adding text to your section you can just start typing anywhere, the text will change lines at the margin of the page or it will change
	lines at the double slash \\.

The video has very detailed explanations that we can always refer to for when we’re editing the paper, we could talk on how to structure the content first on Tuesday, January 22 and work as we go.
