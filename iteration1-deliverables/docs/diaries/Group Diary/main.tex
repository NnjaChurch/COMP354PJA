\end{itemize}
\section{Outcomes:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Documented the meeting and pushed it into Github;
    \item Made a team schedule (using Doodle) for the team to ask if we want to meet before 9:30pm since it is late and some of us live far from the university. We all agreed that we would meet from 8:30pm to 10:00pm;
    \item We contacted the absentees, Annes messaged Robert Laviolette, Yassine Laaroussi, Benson Chan through Moodle to make first contact with them and let them know what we did so far, Kevin contacted Ke Ma;
    \item We made the subgroups for the first increment.
    \item 1.	We need to confirm with professor if we can use IntelliJ instead of eclipse and any other tool he suggested.
    2.	Tips when coding: indent with tabs. Comment your work.
    3.	The code in General: Cards will be objects in a 2D array, features like revealed/unrevealed, color red/blue/beige/black and types.
    4.	We will be using JavaFX instead of Swing. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE. As David proposed. 
    5.	We might want to meet up sooner than 9:30PM since it is late and some of us live far from the university. There is a LAB hour for COMP354 at 19:15PM before our LAB for PK teams. We should be able to attend that LAB at 8:30pm\\

\item Annes explained the project and the task overall for increment 1 for the Documenters,how to upload a file and make a pull request, explained where the GameStructure file is, its content and how the documenters may use it for their work. I also showed where Kevin posted the .java classes and explained to the team what is needed to do. A requirements document. Showed where the teacher posted a template of the requirements document which is a LaTex file;\\
\item We posted a doodle link (https://doodle.com/poll/x5ci3a3p5zkfmi2d) if people want to meet up before 9:30pm on Wednesdays since it will leave us an early exit to those who find it taxing to stay as late as 11. Plus we can stay later if we need more time in the meeting.
\item Took notes and created the meeting document of what everything happened and what we all did, uploaded that document into Slack and Github;

 \item Documented the meeting and pushed it into Github;
 \item We talked about LaTex, Souheil and Carl watched Derek Bannasâ€™s video about LaTex, Souheil posted on Github his notes.

\section {Full Team Meeting 2}
{\bf Date:} Wednesday 23-01-2019\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:30 pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 10:15 pm \\
{\bf Who:} Annes Cherid, Souheil Al-Awar, David Boivin, Carl Neil Cortes-Nazareth, Gaoshuo Cui, Karim	Loulou, Kevin McAllister, Yogesh Nimbhorkar, Ke Ma, Robert Laviolette, Benson Chan;\\
{\bf Where:} Lab H-907 \\
\section{Activities:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Annes took notes and created the meeting document of what everything happened and what we all did, uploaded that document into Slack and Github;
\item At 9:45pm, Annes took the team together and talked about the Iteration due date and the Demo due date. Due date for the Increment 1 is Feb 10th and demo is Feb 7th. Made sure everybody is on the same page. We cleared out what the documenters need from the coders. We talked about JUnit and the coders will take care of it later on when the code will be ready to operate. The documenters heard how the coders plan to implement their assigned use case. 
\item Karim and David explained us what a use case is, as well as actors and MVC.
\item David showed us a draft GUI using JavaFX.\\
\item Kevin made a code that will auto-generate keycards, we will need to generate 10 keycards for increment 1.
\section{Outcomes:} 
\item The coders and the documenters had their own groups and started talking about their tasks
\item Talked about whether we should change into an interface so we could only use one function and pass its parameters.
\item Karim and Kevin talked between them about how to implement the Controller while Yogesh and David were discussing about JavaFx GUI;
\item We use enums for card colors to reduce the classes.
\item The strategy is Randomize/Sequential strategy.
\item Also the main menu came into discussion: should it be
\item A GUI with (new game/Quit);
\item A simple toolbar (File-New Game, Options-Quit/About).
\item Use of stacks for the undo/redo function: Which holds the variable and then redo to go back. We might need to set up 2 stacks.
\item Also some of the Classes will be : Cards class which stores cards, KeyCard will generate a random key card for the Spymaster, GameBoard will have the actual game with counter of number of team members remaining and whose turn it is as well as a verbose of what the user needs to do, Player, an interface with computerplayer and humanplayer;
\item For documenters: Started a sample LaTex file;
\item While they were discussing, definitions and diagrams were mentioned, Examples of a Use Case: User->Click next->Picks Random Number->process it accordingly; MVC, Use cases, Planning and LaTex were also mentioned; Need to get list diagram of keycards/names from Kevin; The subgroup made a bullet-point list to fill out. They assigned what every team member has to do (see Annex 2)
\item The requirements document has already started;

\section {Full Team Meeting 3}
{\bf Date:} Wednesday 31-01-2019\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:36 pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 10:10 pm \\
{\bf Who:}Annes Cherid, Souheil Al-Awar, David Boivin, Carl Neil Cortes-Nazareth, Gaoshuo Cui, Karim	Loulou, Kevin McAllister, Ke Ma, Robert Laviolette;   \\
{\bf Where:} Lab H-907 \\
\section{Activities:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Took notes and created the meeting document of what everything happened and what we all did, Annes uploaded that document into Slack and Github;
\item TA came to us for a pre-demo;
\item Pre-Demo summary for Documenters: There is a good amount of information written already, 7 pages containing the purpose, the context, the business goals, some of the domain concepts, some of the use case 1; Domain model (shows a basic ideology of the game), use cases and MVC architecture not ready yet; We need to write a brief description on every diagram. Implement a design pattern; Need a table of content, make sure everything is organized;
\item Pre-Demo summary for Coders: Most of the code is ready; Karim made a database for us to use; Still working on the strategy, but the implementation is basically finished; TA need only basic functional UI; Unit test: run some basic tests, need to setup specific events, basic tests (nothing too complicated like Spymaster actions, command strategy); it is basically what we expect from these events and what it gives us. Controller will make the model reveal the card;  We are using observers/observables so that whenever the card is modified the observer will be like <<this card is modified>>, it was swapped, then revealed from hidden status and does its job whatever it needs to do like reduce number of teammates to find or trigger event of end of turn. Kevin explained how the code works with the MVC concept;  Make sure specify who did what on coding and documents; Every document should be on LaTex, converted into pdf; A general informative diary and a specific one. Have a compiled java executable file;
\item Kevin and David talked about how to link messages between GUI and the code.
\clearpage
\item At 9:40pm, Annes took the team together and talked about the Iteration due date and the Demo due date. We have presented our work of the system for iteration 1 to the TA. The team meeting reviewed what needs to be done over the next week to get the application ready for submission; the team should review status of the document, and review the timeline overall for iteration 1, assigned tasks and deadlines, for both the software and the document to be ready for submission. There will be a team meeting for the documenters on Tuesday 5th Feb. @4:00pm.
\section{Outcomes:} 
\item In addition for documenters: Documenters will have some work done during the weekend: Use cases: Carl, Gaoshuo and Benson, Robert: MVC, Souheil: Domain model, Business Goals: Makeup stuff, up to us to decide, Goals should be linked with the output it brings and how we are going to achieve them; Constraints: Time of a click-> Timing of events, this is a guideline of how our program should run and act.
